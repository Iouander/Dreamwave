Sadly, this doesn't work like FNF's sprite sheets.

Instead, each folder will contain seperate sprites that are used in each animation.

Your "Your Character/Left" folder will have all sprites used for it's Left animation for when
the left key is pressed. You get the idea.

So no large images containing all sprites, instead you split them up into single images and
put them into their specific folder.

After that, in-game, you will go to the Custom Character Creator in the mod tab from the menu and 
setup your animations and offsets.
